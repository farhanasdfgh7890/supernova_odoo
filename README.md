## 🌐 Challenge  
**"SynergySphere – Advanced Team Collaboration Platform"**  

The goal is to design and build a **desktop and mobile-ready platform** that acts like a central nervous system for team collaboration.  
It should go beyond task tracking and communication, proactively helping teams stay organized, manage resources effectively, and avoid bottlenecks before they occur.

## 🎯 Vision  
SynergySphere is built on a simple idea:  
> *Teams do their best work when their tools truly support how they think, communicate, and move forward together.*  

At its core, **SynergySphere** helps teams:  
- Continuously improve  
- Stay aligned  
- Work smarter every day

## 🛠 Mission  
Deliver a **functional MVP** for both mobile and desktop that allows users to:  
- ✅ Register/Login securely  
- ✅ Create & manage projects  
- ✅ Add team members  
- ✅ Assign tasks with due dates & statuses (To-Do, In Progress, Done)  
- ✅ Track project progress in a clear, visual way

- ✅ Receive basic notifications for important updates  

All interfaces are **responsive, clean, and intuitive**.
